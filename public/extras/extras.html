     <p>The children with Autism are provided with the services required for mainstreaming. The sensory integration and school readiness skills are necessary to prepare them to go into the society. The prime area focused by Aadita is the social skills. The child who is integrated in regular schools learns few letters, concepts but the area of prime concern is the social skills. After giving a deep thought about it Aadita is conducting social skill training which is giving excellent results. Our parental feed back speaks about it.</p>
